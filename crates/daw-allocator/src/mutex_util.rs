//! Mutex utility patterns for RT-adjacent code.
//!
//! Inspired by Helgobox's `mutex_util.rs`
//! (https://github.com/helgoboss/helgobox).
//!
//! Key patterns:
//! - **Poison recovery** — never panic on poisoned mutex, recover the inner value
//! - **Non-blocking try-lock** — return `None` instead of blocking
//! - **Timed lock warning** — warn if lock acquisition takes too long (debug)

///
/// Standard `Mutex::lock()` panics on poisoned mutex. This recovers the inner

/// thread's cleanup code.
