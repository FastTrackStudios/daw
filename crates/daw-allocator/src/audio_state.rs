//! Lock-free global audio state.

//! Inspired by Helgobox's `GlobalAudioState`
//! (https://github.com/helgoboss/helgobox, `global_audio_state.rs`).
//!
//! All fields are atomics — safe to read from any thread without locking.
//! The RT audio thread calls `advance()` once per audio block to update state.
