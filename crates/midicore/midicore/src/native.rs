//! The platform's native MIDI input, behind one type.
//!
//! [`MidiInput`] is what an app opens; it never names a backend. Which one it
//! wraps is decided here, per target:
//!
//! | target | [`Backend`] |
//! |---|---|
//! | Linux | `midicore_pipewire::MidiInput` — one PipeWire node |
//! | macOS | `midicore_macos::CoreMidiInput` — one CoreMIDI client + port |
//! | wasm32 | `midicore_wasm::WebMidiInput` — one Web MIDI access |
//! | anything else (with `midir`) | `midicore_midir::SelectableInput` |
//!
//! Every one implements [`InputBackend`](crate::InputBackend); see that
//! module for the contract (one input, a union of selectors, hot-plug handled
//! inside).
