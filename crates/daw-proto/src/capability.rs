//! Backend capability declarations
//!
//! DAW backends and file format implementations support different subsets of
//! the protocol. This module provides a way for backends to declare which
//! feature domains they can read and/or write, so consumers can query support
//! upfront rather than discovering it through `NotSupported` errors.
//!
//! # Feature Domains
//!
//! Each [`Capability`] corresponds to a coarse feature domain (e.g., tracks,
//! items, FX chains). A backend declares separate read and write support for
//! each domain via [`FeatureSupport`].
//!
//! # Compliance Profiles
//!
//! Named profiles group capabilities into meaningful levels:
//!
//! - [`TIMELINE_BASIC`]: Minimum viable timeline import (project + tracks + items)
//! - [`MIX_RECALL`]: Full mix state (routing, FX, automation)
//! - [`FULL`]: Everything the protocol defines
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use daw_proto::capability::{Capability, FeatureSupport};
//!
//! let support = FeatureSupport::new()
//!     .read_write(&[Capability::Project, Capability::Tracks, Capability::Items])
//!     .read_only(&[Capability::Automation, Capability::FxChain]);
//!
//! assert!(support.can_read(Capability::Automation));
//! assert!(!support.can_write(Capability::Automation));
//! assert!(support.can_read_write(Capability::Tracks));
//! ```
