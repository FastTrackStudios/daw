//! Client-side plumbing for architect `#[subscribe]` streams.
//!
//! A `#[subscribe]` stream is argless on the wire — the server sends
//! every event and the client filters. [`EventStream`] wraps the raw
//! `vox::Rx` from the stream call with an admit predicate (project
//! guid, `BusFilter`, …) and owns the in-flight subscribe call: the
//! call future never completes while the subscription lives (vox
//! scopes channels to their request), so it's parked on a spawned
//! task that is released when the `EventStream` is dropped —
//! cancelling the call is the unsubscribe.

use core::future::Future;

// Target-conditional future bound. The in-flight `events(tx)` subscribe call
// parked below captures vox connection senders, which are `Send` on native
// (multi-thread tokio) but `!Send` on wasm32 (single-threaded vox runtime,
// `Rc<RefCell<…>>`). On native `MaybeSend: Send` (blanket for every `T: Send`),
// so the bound is byte-for-byte `Send` and the spawned task stays `Send` for
// `moire::task::spawn`; on wasm32 the bound vanishes and `moire::task::spawn`
// maps to `spawn_local` (no `Send` required). Native codegen is unchanged.
