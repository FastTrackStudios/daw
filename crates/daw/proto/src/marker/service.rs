//! Markers service trait.
//!
//! One canonical declaration, decorated with `#[architect::rpc]`. The
//! macro derives the async vox client + a `serve` function from this
//! sync trait — backends impl `Markers` directly (zero-cost in-process
//! call sites), and remote callers reach the same surface via the
//! auto-emitted `MarkersClient` over vox. See `architect/DESIGN.md`.
//!
//! Backends are **stateless singletons** — they don't carry per-project
//! state. Project context flows through method calls. That keeps one
//! backend type per runtime (`Reaper`, `Standalone`, `RppFile`, …)
//! and lets a single mount serve every project a binary touches.
