//! Backend-agnostic main-thread affinity.
//!
//! Some DAW backends require certain operations to run with a specific thread
//! affinity. REAPER is the canonical example: its FFI (`EnumProjects`, track
//! enumeration, etc.) may only be called from REAPER's single main thread, and
//! calling it from a vox worker thread deadlocks on REAPER's internal lock.
//! Other backends — `daw-standalone`, tests, future engines — have no such
//! requirement and can run the work inline on any thread.
//!
//! This module defines the abstraction. Each backend installs its own
//! [`MainThreadExecutor`] (REAPER installs a `TaskSupport`-backed one;
//! standalone installs none). Service code calls [`query`] / [`run`] and stays
//! backend-agnostic:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let projects = daw_proto::main_thread::query(move || daw.list()).await;
//! ```
//!
//! With an executor installed, the closure runs under the required affinity and
//! the result is awaited back. With none installed, the closure runs inline —
//! a no-op bounce — so the exact same service code runs against standalone.
