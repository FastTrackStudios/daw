//! Regions service trait.
//!
//! Stateless singleton backends — `ProjectContext` flows through every
//! call. `#[architect::rpc]` derives the async vox client + `serve`
//! function; backends impl `Regions` directly. Same pattern as
//! `marker/service.rs` and `track/service.rs`.
//!
//! Scope trimmed from the previous async `RegionService`. Retired
//! surfaces (range queries, lane placement, render matrix, navigation
//! goto, subscribe) land on follow-on sibling traits if/when a real
//! consumer needs them.
