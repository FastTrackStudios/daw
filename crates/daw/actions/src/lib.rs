//! Backend-agnostic DAW action modules.
//!
//! `#[architect::actions]` traits plus the logic behind them, for
//! capabilities that are plain DAW operations rather than any one
//! product's domain: pre-roll, record control, track grouping, take
//! ranking, auto-colouring. These used to live in `session`, which meant
//! reaching into a *session* crate for things with nothing to do with
//! setlists or songs.
//!
//! Why a separate crate and not `daw-proto`: these drive a live backend
//! (`daw::reaper::Reaper`) rather than merely defining the contract, and
//! `daw-reaper` already depends on `daw-proto` — putting them there would
//! be a dependency cycle. `daw-proto` stays the backend-agnostic
//! *definition* layer (service traits, `TracksExt`, `TrackTree`); this
//! crate is the layer above it that actually drives a backend.
//!
//! Registration follows the usual shape: the `#[architect::actions]`
//! macro emits `register_<name>_actions(backend, imp)`, and the caller
//! composes any namespace nesting by wrapping its `ActionBackend` in
//! `architect::action::ScopedActionBackend`.
