//! The wasm **streamer queue** — the browser's stand-in for the native
//! streamer thread pool (W13 of `crates/signal/docs/browser-keys-rig.md`).
//!
//! Same contract as the native pool in [`super::stream`]: the audio thread
//! marks which chunks it wants and returns IMMEDIATELY; decoding happens
//! somewhere else and the decoded chunks appear in memory the audio thread
//! already reads. What differs is only how "somewhere else" is spelled.
//!
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown` has no `std::thread::spawn` even with atomics,
//! so the workers are Web Workers the PAGE spawns, each instantiating the
//! same module over the SAME shared `WebAssembly.Memory`. Because the heap
//! is shared, a worker can operate on an `Arc<StreamedSample>` the audio
//! thread created — it only needs the pointer. So the queue carries raw
//! pointers to leaked `Arc`s, and a worker reclaims each one after filling.
//!
//! Everything here is lock-free by necessity, not preference: `atomic.wait`
//! TRAPS on the audio thread (and on the main thread), so the producer side
//! may never block. Producers push into a fixed ring with a CAS.
//!
//! The PARKING is deliberately not done here. Rust's `memory_atomic_wait32`
//! /`notify` intrinsics are nightly-only (`stdarch_wasm_atomic_wait`), and
//! this crate compiles on STABLE for every native target — a `#![feature]`
//! attribute would break all of them to serve one wasm build. So the worker
//! parks in JS instead: [`wake_addr`] hands out the byte address of a word
//! in this heap, the worker calls `Atomics.wait` on it with a short timeout,
//! and then calls [`drain`]. A timed wait needs no notify at all, which also
//! means the audio thread never has to call out to JS to wake anyone — it
//! just pushes and returns.
