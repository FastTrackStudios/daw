//! Core, dependency-light types for `fts-story`.
//!
//! This crate intentionally does NOT depend on `dioxus`. It defines:
//!
//! - [`Story`] — the metadata + render-fn pointer that `#[story]` produces.
//! - [`Knob`] / [`KnobValue`] — typed inputs to a story.
//! - [`Interaction`] — a step in a recorded interaction script (click, type,
//!   key press, scroll, wait, snapshot, assert).
//! - [`STORIES`] — the global, compile-time registry populated via
//!   [`linkme::distributed_slice`]. Both the interactive shell and the
//!   headless VRT runner enumerate stories from this slice.
//!
//! Renderer-specific concerns (rendering Dioxus VDOMs, rasterizing via
//! Blitz, dispatching events into a `DioxusDocument`) live in
//! `fts-story-runtime` and `fts-story-snapshots`. Anything that needs to talk about
//! a story without pulling in Dioxus belongs here.

// linkme 0.3 doesn't support `target_os = "unknown"` (i.e.
// wasm32-unknown-unknown). Apps that consume `fts-ui` from a browser
// wasm target still need the rest of fts-ui to compile, so on wasm32
// the registry collapses to an empty array. Story enumeration only
// runs in the native shell / VRT runner anyway.
