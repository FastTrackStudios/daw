//! A grid that follows the zoom.
//!
//! A fixed grid is wrong at both ends: zoomed out, sixteenths collapse
//! into a grey band; zoomed in, whole notes leave nothing to snap to.
//! The adaptive grid picks the finest division whose lines are still at
//! least a stated distance apart, and re-picks it whenever the view
//! changes.
//!
//! Modelled on Ilias-Timon Poulakis's Adaptive Grid scripts for REAPER
//! (`Reaper-Tools`, MIT), which are the reference implementation of this
//! behaviour and what users of both programs will expect it to feel
//! like. The arithmetic below is theirs; the shape is not, and the
//! difference matters in one place — see [`Adaptive::fit`].
//!
//! ## Where the numbers come from
//!
//! Everything is expressed against **one measure**, because that is the
//! unit a division is a fraction of:
//!
//! - `measure_px` — how wide one measure is on screen, which is the only
//!   thing the caller has to know how to compute. It carries the zoom,
//!   the tempo map and the time signature all at once, so this crate
//!   needs none of them.
//! - [`Density::spacing`] — the closest two gridlines may sit, in
//!   pixels.
//!
//! The finest grid that fits is then `measure_px / spacing` lines per
//! measure, and [`Adaptive::fit`] snaps the *current* grid up or down to
//! it in whole steps of [`Adaptive::factor`].
//!
//! ## Why it snaps by a factor rather than choosing outright
//!
//! Scaling the current division by a power of two keeps everything about
//! it except its size. A triplet grid stays a triplet grid, a dotted one
//! stays dotted, and a project in 6/8 keeps whatever the user chose —
//! because the only thing that changed is how many times it was halved.
//! Choosing a division from a table instead would quietly straighten
//! every grid the first time the user zoomed.
