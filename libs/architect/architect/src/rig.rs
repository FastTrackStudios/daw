//! Rig-backend glue — the shared scaffold every instrument-rig backend
//! serves through, so rigs **cannot drift**.
//!
//! A rig backend (guitar / drums / keys / synth) is a cloneable handle over
//! shared state that (a) mounts its `#[architect::rpc]` services as a
//! [`LayerRouter`], (b) fans live updates out of a [`PubSub`] hub behind a
//! `#[subscribe]` stream, and (c) runs one background **meter/status pump**:
//! a fixed-interval loop that publishes per-tick telemetry (meters + recent
//! MIDI), publishes full status only when the transport running-state flips,
//! and periodically rescans MIDI ports for hot-plug. That plumbing was
//! copy-pasted per rig — and drifted (one rig missed the hot-plug rescan,
//! another the once-start guard, each declared its own interval constant).
//!
//! [`RigBackend`] is the one scaffold: `router()` is provided
//! (`self.clone().into_router()`), the hub comes from [`events_hub()`]
//! (`PubSub::sliding(EVENT_BACKLOG)`), and
//! [`spawn_meter_pump`](RigBackend::spawn_meter_pump) ships the interval, the
//! once-start guard, the running-edge detection, the hot-plug rescan, and
//! per-tick panic containment. A rig implements only what is
//! instrument-specific: its event enum, its service methods, and the pump
//! hooks' bodies.
//!
//! The pump is deliberately a plain OS thread, not an async task:
//! [`PubSub::publish`] takes a lock (never call it on a real-time thread) and
//! the loop is a 30 Hz sleeper with no await points — a dedicated named
//! thread is the honest shape, and it must keep running even if every async
//! runtime is busy.
