//! The mountable RPC surface for architect-auth sessions.
//!
//! One `#[architect::rpc]` trait covering the session lifecycle:
//! sign-up, password sign-in, validate (`current_session`), refresh,
//! `whoami`, and sign-out. The trait is all-async, so `vox::service`
//! applies to it directly — the macro additionally emits the `serve` /
//! `layer` verbs, the deferred-bind `Service` token, and a glob-safe
//! [`prelude`] so the service mounts like any other architect service:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use architect_auth::{AuthVoxService, auth_service_layer};
//!
//! let router = architect::LayerRouter::new()
//!     .merge(auth_service_layer(AuthVoxService::new(auth)));
//! ```
//!
//! Engine-only capabilities (TOTP, API keys, invitations, …) stay off
//! this surface on purpose: they remain reachable through
//! `ArchitectAuth` directly, and adding them later is purely additive —
//! new trait methods, no re-mount.
