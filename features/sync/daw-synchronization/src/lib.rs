//! Backend-agnostic DAW state synchronization engine.
//!
//! Replicates DAW state between peers by subscribing to the
//! streaming service traits in `daw-proto`, wrapping each event in a
//! [`SyncEvent`] envelope with origin peer + sequence, broadcasting
//! outbound, and applying remote envelopes back through the daw
//! mutation API.
//!
//! Backend-agnostic by construction: any backend that implements the
//! streaming traits (`TransportStream`, `MarkersStream`, …) gets
//! synchronization for free. REAPER↔REAPER is the canonical use
//! case; REAPER↔Standalone (testing), REAPER↔ProTools, or any other
//! pair work without engine changes.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! Local DAW (DawEventHub broadcasts at ~30Hz)
//!   ├─ TrackStreamEvent ─┐
//!   ├─ TransportEvent ───┤
//!   ├─ MarkerStreamEvent ┤
//!   └─ … ────────────────┤
//!                         ▼
//!                SynchronizationEngine
//!                   ├─ wrap in SyncEvent { origin: self, seq: N }
//!                   ├─ check suppression (skip if echo)
//!                   └─ broadcast outbound (consumed by sync-repo
//!                      network adapter, applied to remote peer)
//!
//! Remote SyncEvent arrives (via `apply_remote`)
//!   ├─ filter: origin == self → skip
//!   ├─ record in suppression set
//!   └─ apply via daw mutation API
//! ```
//!
//! Network transport (peer discovery, mDNS, Ableton Link, the actual
//! socket between two peers) is **not** in this crate. That lives in
//! the FastTrackStudio/sync repo, which depends on this crate and
//! wires `outbound()` → peer connection → `apply_remote()` on the
//! other side.
