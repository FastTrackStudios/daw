//! Drift correction: what to do about the difference between this
//! engine and the leader.
//!
//! Given this engine's latest [`AudioSnapshot`] and the leader's
//! [`Position`], both in one clock, [`DriftController::step`] answers:
//!
//! - **Locate** — far out (a start, a seek, a stall): be at the leader's
//!   place at a moment a little ahead, so the engine can land on it
//!   exactly instead of chasing it. Starting is a locate too.
//! - **Rate** — close: run a fraction of a percent fast or slow until the
//!   gap is gone. Proportional-integral: the proportional part closes a
//!   gap (a millisecond bleeds off in about a second at 0.1 % — well under
//!   anything audible, and no clicks, which a seek would make); the
//!   integral part learns the two devices' crystal mismatch (tens of ppm,
//!   constant), which a proportional loop alone would leave as a standing
//!   gap of mismatch × convergence. Clamped to ±`max_rate_deviation`.
//! - **Stop** — the leader stopped.
//! - **Hold** — nothing to do.
//!
//! Inside the deadband (a couple of samples) the rate goes back to the
//! leader's: the two sample clocks' own wander is the noise floor there,
//! and chasing it would only wobble.
//!
//! After a locate, the controller waits for a snapshot taken after it
//! landed before judging again — the engine's report of where it is lags
//! the command by a buffer or two.
