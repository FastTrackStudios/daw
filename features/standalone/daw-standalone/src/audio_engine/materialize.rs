//! Audio source materialization — turn `source_file_path` strings on
//! takes into decoded PCM stashed in `ProjectState.audio_sources`.
//!
//! The function takes a caller-supplied resolver closure so the same
//! code works on native (read from disk) and WASM (file bytes
//! provided via browser upload / fetch). Decoding is via fts-sample
//! (`feature = "decode"` or `feature = "audio"`).
//!
//! Typical use:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use daw_standalone::audio_engine::materialize::{materialize_audio, MaterializeReport};
//!
//! let report: MaterializeReport = materialize_audio(&daw, &project_guid, |path| {
//!     std::fs::read(path).map_err(|e| e.to_string())
//! });
//! eprintln!("loaded {} sources, skipped {}", report.loaded, report.failed.len());
//! ```
