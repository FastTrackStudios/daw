//! Fetching streamed media in the order it will be heard.
//!
//! A take streamed from elsewhere (Task, a peer) plays what has arrived
//! ([`super::streamed::RemoteOgg`] over a [`SparseBytes`]). What arrives
//! next is decided here, for every streamed take at once, by one measure:
//! **how soon it will be heard**. For each take the bytes under
//! `[playhead, playhead + horizon]` — the item's span mapped through its
//! source offset and rate to the file's frames, then through its page
//! index to bytes — that have not arrived, split into bounded requests so
//! a change of plan (a seek) takes effect within one request; the take's
//! header first of all, and any range a reader actually hit
//! ([`SparseBytes::wanted`]) before any plan. The horizon starts at a few
//! seconds and widens as what is near is in, so every track's next
//! seconds come before any track's later minutes, and a 30-minute file is
//! fetched from where it is being played, not from its start.
//!
//! [`plan`] is the pure decision; [`drive`] runs it against a
//! [`RangeFetch`] (the transport: HTTP ranges from Task, a range-read over
//! iroh from a peer), a few requests in flight, re-planning as bytes land
//! and the playhead moves.
