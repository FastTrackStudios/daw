//! Persistent source-level waveform peaks — the `.sessionpeaks` cache.
//!
//! Take-level peaks depend on placement, play rate and stretch markers,
//! which is why [`crate::peak`]'s in-memory cache is revision-keyed. The
//! *expensive* part, though, is scanning the source PCM — and that is a
//! property of the media file alone. So the disk artifact lives at the
//! SOURCE level, in REAPER's own format, so REAPER and FTS share caches
//! where projects overlap.
//!
//! Where it sits is [`dawfile_reaper::sessionpeaks`]'s business: reads
//! try `Media/Peaks/<name>.sessionpeaks`, then REAPER's
//! `Media/peaks/<name>.reapeaks`, then `<name>.reapeaks` beside the
//! media; writes go to the first. A session `session peaks` has already
//! built, or REAPER has already scanned, costs this nothing.
//!
//! Flow: the first peaks request for a source loads a valid cache, or
//! scans the PCM once, writes the cache, and keeps the parsed mipmap in
//! a process-global map (keyed by media path, revalidated by stamp).
//! Cold starts after that fold coarse-zoom peaks from the cache instead
//! of rescanning gigabytes of PCM. Fine zooms (below the finest mipmap
//! ratio — `sr/300`, 160 samples/peak at 48 kHz) still read PCM: the
//! mipmap can't resolve them.
//!
//! Validation matches REAPER's model: the sidecar stores the source
//! file's size and mtime packed into one u64
//! ([`dawfile_reaper::reapeaks::stamp`]), and we additionally require
//! the channel count, sample rate and length (within one fine peak
//! window) to match the opened source. Anything stale is recomputed and
//! rewritten. Writing the same stamp REAPER writes is what keeps the
//! sidecars mutually usable — a bare timestamp there is a file REAPER
//! rebuilds the moment it opens the project.
//!
//! In-memory sources ([`AudioSource::Memory`], compressed decodes) get no
//! cache — their `min_max_block` is a RAM walk, cheap enough to redo.
