//! `.sessionpeaks` — the session's own waveform cache, in REAPER's format.
//!
//! # The file IS RPKN
//!
//! A `.sessionpeaks` file is byte-for-byte a `.reapeaks` file: the same
//! `RPKN` magic, the same header, the same `sr/300` ×15 ×20 mipmap ladder,
//! the same size-and-mtime source stamp, the same interleaved
//! `(max, min)` i16 pairs. It is **not** a superset. Rename one and
//! REAPER reads it; rename a REAPER one and we read it.
//! [`super::reapeaks`] is the single codec for both.
//!
//! That is a deliberate refusal to extend. The temptation is to add a
//! fourth, finer level, a content hash instead of the size-and-mtime
//! stamp, or a per-channel RMS band — all of which would be useful, and
//! any of which would turn the file into something REAPER opens as
//! garbage. The interchange is worth more than the extras: these sessions
//! are worked on in REAPER *and* in the session app, often on the same
//! folder, and a cache only one of them can use is a cache that gets
//! built twice.
//!
//! What differs is only **where the file sits and what it is called**:
//!
//! | writer | path |
//! |---|---|
//! | session | `Media/Peaks/Bass.wav.sessionpeaks` |
//! | REAPER (peaks folder) | `Media/peaks/Bass.wav.reapeaks` |
//! | REAPER (beside media) | `Media/Bass.wav.reapeaks` |
//!
//! `Media/Peaks/` mirrors `Media/Proxies/` — one folder per derived
//! artifact, beside the media it derives from, inside the session folder
//! so it is versioned, synced and *served* with everything else in it.
//! That last part is the point of the separate extension: a share link
//! serves any non-media file whole, so the browser fetches
//! `<link>/doc/Media/Peaks/Bass.wav.sessionpeaks` and draws real
//! waveforms without ever touching the audio.
//!
//! [`read_any`] looks in all three places, newest-first by preference, so
//! a session REAPER has already scanned costs nothing to open.
