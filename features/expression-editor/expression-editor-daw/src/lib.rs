//! Adapter between the expression editor's document and the DAW MIDI
//! API.
//!
//! Depends on the `daw` **facade**, never on a backend, which is what
//! lets one editor drive a live REAPER take and a standalone project
//! without knowing which it has. A `.mid` file arrives through the same
//! service, so all three paths produce the same [`ExpressionDoc`].
//!
//! The conversion is the interesting part, and it is deliberately pure
//! and testable without a DAW: [`to_doc`] and [`to_content`] are plain
//! functions over snapshots.
//!
//! ## Where the editor's model and MIDI disagree
//!
//! - MIDI channels are 0-based on the wire and 1-based to musicians.
//!   The editor stores the musician's number (2..=16 for MPE members),
//!   so every crossing converts.
//! - The editor's pitch curve is **semitones relative to the note's
//!   row**; MIDI carries a 14-bit bend word whose meaning depends on
//!   the instrument's bend range. The document's `bend_range` is the
//!   only thing that makes those two comparable, and it has to travel
//!   with the conversion or every curve reads wrong by a factor.
//! - Pitch bend is per *channel*, not per note. Reconstructing which
//!   note owns a bend event is exactly the MPE ownership problem the
//!   core already models, so bends are attributed to the note sounding
//!   on that channel and flagged ambiguous when two are.
