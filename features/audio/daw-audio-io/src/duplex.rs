//! Cross-platform **duplex audio backend** — one realtime callback that gets
//! capture *and* playback buffers for the same cycle (no ring bridge between
//! separate input/output streams). This is what low-latency DAW engines use.
//!
//! The contract is platform-agnostic: a caller hands [`start`](DuplexBackend::start)
//! a [`DuplexConfig`] (how many capture/playback channels, desired latency) and a
//! `process` closure, and the backend invokes that closure from the realtime
//! thread every block. Each platform supplies its own implementation behind the
//! [`Backend`] alias:
//!
//! | OS | impl | mechanism |
//! |----|------|-----------|
//! | Linux | [`crate::duplex_pw::PipewireBackend`] | `pw_filter` (capture+playback ports, one process cb) |
//! | macOS | [`crate::duplex_coreaudio::CoreAudioBackend`] | AUHAL unit, input pulled in the output render callback |
//! | Windows | _todo_ | WASAPI duplex / ASIO |
//!
//! The rig's signal processing (tap input channel → FX chain → stereo out) is the
//! `process` closure — identical on every platform; only the backend differs.
