//! Matching the two frame sequences.
//!
//! Banded dynamic time warping. The band is the important part and it is
//! placed in three moves, each of which fixes a failure the previous one
//! leaves:
//!
//! 1. **Around the diagonal**, because the same moment of two takes of
//!    one part is at roughly the same time in both.
//! 2. **Around the diagonal scaled to the two lengths**, because two
//!    takes of a four-minute song routinely differ by a couple of percent
//!    in total length, and a band around `i` has drifted several seconds
//!    off the true path by the end.
//! 3. **Offset by the measured macro lag** ([`crate::offset`]), because a
//!    dub that came in a second late is not near the diagonal at all, and
//!    widening the band to reach it is exactly what a band exists to
//!    prevent.
//!
//! ## Steps are not free
//!
//! A plain DTW charges nothing for moving sideways, so when two frames
//! are nearly equally good it will take a step, then another, then
//! another — the "staircase", where a phrase is held still and then
//! yanked. Two rules stop it: every non-diagonal step costs
//! [`WarpConfig::slope_penalty`], and a step in the same direction as the
//! one before it costs [`WarpConfig::staircase_penalty`] times more, so a
//! run of them gets rapidly more expensive than spreading the same
//! correction out.
//!
//! Both are waived where the frame being consumed is silent. Stretching
//! a gap between phrases is genuinely free — nothing is sounding, so
//! nothing is distorted — and this is what lets the slack collect in the
//! gaps instead of inside words.
//!
//! ## Why the stretch ratio is bounded later, not here
//!
//! The usual bound on how far a warp may stray is the Itakura
//! parallelogram, which constrains the path by tying it to *both*
//! corners of the matrix. That is wrong for this problem: the path here
//! is deliberately free at both ends, so that a dub which starts late is
//! not forced to stretch its opening silence to reach the reference's
//! first frame. The ratio is instead enforced where it turns into audio,
//! in [`crate::anchors`], on the segments between the warp points that
//! actually get written. A ratio limit on a DTW cell is a limit on
//! nothing anybody hears.
