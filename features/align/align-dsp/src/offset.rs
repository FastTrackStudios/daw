//! Where the dub is, before asking how it is bent.
//!
//! A warping matcher answers "which moment of the dub is which moment of
//! the reference" only over the range it is allowed to search, and that
//! range has to be narrow: the whole reason a band exists is that a wide
//! search finds better *scores* and worse alignments. Which leaves a
//! singer who came in a second late unalignable — the true path is
//! outside the band, and inside the band there is always some
//! cheap-looking wrong answer.
//!
//! So the offset is found first, as one number, and the warp searches
//! around it. This is not an optimisation; it is what makes the warp's
//! narrow band affordable in the first place.
//!
//! ## Two passes
//!
//! 1. **Envelope.** Correlate the two level envelopes at frame rate.
//!    Cheap, and immune to the thing that defeats waveform correlation:
//!    two takes of the same line are not phase-coherent, so their
//!    waveforms correlate poorly even when perfectly aligned, while their
//!    envelopes correlate strongly.
//! 2. **Waveform.** Correlate the raw samples, but only within a small
//!    radius of the envelope's answer. Where the two takes *are* phase
//!    coherent — two mics on one source, a re-amp, a bounced copy — this
//!    finds the offset to the sample. Where they are not, it finds
//!    nothing useful, which is why its result is only accepted when it
//!    scores well.
//!
//! Both passes are normalized cross-correlation, computed through an FFT
//! and normalized by the energy actually overlapping at each lag. The
//! normalization is the part that matters: raw correlation is largest
//! wherever the most signal overlaps, which is always zero lag, so an
//! unnormalized search reports "no offset" for everything.
