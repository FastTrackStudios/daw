//! Integrated REAPER extension runtime helpers.
//!
//! This crate is for extension code loaded directly into REAPER. It builds the
//! DAW service client in-process through `LocalCaller`, so action registration
//! and main-thread REAPER API calls do not go through `daw-bridge`, sockets, or
//! shared memory.

    // handler never ran. It presents as a panel that will not open, with
    // nothing in any log, because nothing failed — the message simply had
    // no sender.
